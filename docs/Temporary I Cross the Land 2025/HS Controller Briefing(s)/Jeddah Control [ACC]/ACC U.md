## Notes

- The callsigns "Jeddah Upper" or "Jeddah Control" may be used during communications.
- Please note that the Upper Control will only provide coverage for the specified Area Control Centers (ACCs) above FL245. As a result, top-down service will not be available for any aerodromes.
- It is crucial to maintain a minimum separation of 15-20 nautical miles horizontally or 1000 feet vertically between aircraft at all times.
- The semi-circular rule must be adhered to in this airspace, which is also RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum) compliant.
- Arrival clearances for OEJN (or any other aerodrome) will not be issued by the Upper Control. Such clearances should be obtained from Jeddah Terminal Control.
- Jeddah Terminal Control is responsible for covering the Control Area (CTA) of Jeddah Airport from FL150 to FL600.
- Arrival traffic should not receive initial descents without prior coordination with Jeddah Terminal Control.
- Sequenced traffic handed off to Terminal must be lateral separated by a minimum of 10nm.

## What to Expect

- Two traffic streams: one via the north to enter the FIR via "SILKA" and one from the west to enter the FIR via "DEDLI". Western arrivals will be sent to terminal control by Cairo immediately, thus, Jeddah Upper will only control the northern stream.
- Traffic above 410 may be too high, and in that case, coordinate with Terminal Control for an early step descent.
