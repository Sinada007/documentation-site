**IFR (Instrument Flight Rules)** is a set of regulations that allow pilots to operate aircraft in weather conditions where visibility may be limited. It provides guidelines and procedures for pilots to rely on instruments and navigational aids for navigation and control. 

When the weather conditions are not suitable for VFR, it is referred to as **Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)**. IMC indicates that the weather conditions do not provide sufficient visibility or visual references for safe VFR navigation. In IMC, pilots must rely on instruments and navigational aids to maintain control and navigate the aircraft.

**However**, it's worth noting that pilots can choose to fly under IFR even when the weather conditions are clear. This enables them to follow the established rules and procedures of IFR, regardless of the visibility conditions.
