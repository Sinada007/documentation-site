**VFR (Visual Flight Rules)** is a set of regulations that governs pilot navigation and operation based on visual references and scanning the surrounding airspace. When flying under VFR, pilots are not permitted to fly through or under clouds and must adhere to specific visibility limits. 

When the weather conditions are suitable for VFR, it is referred to as **Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)**. VMC indicates that the weather conditions allow for clear visibility and sufficient visual references for pilots to navigate using visual cues rather than relying solely on instruments.

In Saudi Arabia, VFR operations are allowed when the visibility exceeds **5000 meters**. This ensures that pilots must have a clear line of sight and sufficient visibility to navigate and maintain safe separation from other aircraft and obstacles.
