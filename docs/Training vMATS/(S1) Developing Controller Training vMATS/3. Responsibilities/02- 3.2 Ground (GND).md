A ground controller has several responsibilities, including **granting pushback clearance from stands, providing taxi instructions from aprons to runway holding points, and giving taxi instructions for arriving aircraft to their designated stands**. In essence, ground controllers oversee ground movements on aprons and taxiways.

It is important to note that ground controllers are **not** permitted to give any instructions that would allow a pilot to enter the runway without approval. When a pilot needs to cross a runway, the ground controller's actions will depend on whether a higher-level controller is available or not.

If a higher controller is online, the ground controller can either instruct the pilot to contact the higher controller for crossing approval or coordinate with the higher controller directly to obtain the necessary approval.
